# Session Log: auto_dial Project - Session 1

This log details the work performed and decisions made during the current session on the `auto_dial` project. It serves as a comprehensive record to facilitate seamless continuation in future sessions.

## 1. Initial Project State & Objectives

*   **Project Purpose**: `auto_dial` is a .NET library designed to simplify Dependency Injection (DI) setup in .NET applications through convention-based auto-registration of services.
*   **Initial User Objectives**:
    1.  Resolve existing build issues/bugs preventing the project from compiling.
    2.  Ensure the library registers services by following a predictable dependency path (i.e., dependent services are registered in the correct order).

## 2. Actions Taken & Debugging Process

### 2.1. Initial Build Issue Resolution

*   **Action**: Attempted `dotnet build` to identify initial errors.
*   **Outcome**: Project built with warnings (NU1604) regarding missing inclusive lower bounds for `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` package references. No critical errors were found initially.

### 2.2. Addressing Dependency Resolution & Test Setup

*   **Analysis**: Examined `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs`, `DependencyResolver.cs`, and `AutoDialExtensions.cs`. Identified that `DependencyResolver` already uses a topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) for dependency ordering.
*   **Initial Problem Identification**: Noticed `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs` was filtering out already registered services, potentially preventing `DependencyResolver` from seeing the full graph.
*   **Action**: Modified `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs` to remove the `alreadyRegisteredServices.Contains(interfaceType)` check in `FindImplementations`.
*   **Test Project Management**:
    *   **Action**: User requested to "nuke" the existing test project. Executed `rmdir /s /q tests` (Windows equivalent of `rm -rf tests`).
    *   **Action**: Created a new xUnit test project using `dotnet new xunit -n auto_dial.tests -o tests`.
    *   **Action**: Added a project reference from `auto_dial.tests` to `src/auto-dial.csproj` using `dotnet add tests/auto_dial.tests.csproj reference src/auto-dial.csproj`.
*   **Test Case Addition (Initial)**: Added `DependencyResolutionTests` and `CircularDependencyTests` to `tests/UnitTest1.cs`.
*   **Debugging Test Failures (CS1061 - Missing Extension Method)**:
    *   **Problem**: Tests failed because `PrimeServicesForAutoRegistration` was not found.
    *   **Analysis**: Discovered `PrimeServicesForAutoRegistration` was not actually implemented in `AutoDialExtensions.cs`; the existing method was `AddAutoDial`. The `README.md` was also inconsistent with the code.
    *   **Action**: Modified `src/AutoDialExtensions.cs` to implement `PrimeServicesForAutoRegistration` as an extension method returning `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder`, and removed the old `AddAutoDial` method.
*   **Debugging Test Failures (CS1061 - `CompleteAutoRegistration` Inaccessibility)**:
    *   **Problem**: Tests failed because `CompleteAutoRegistration` was `internal` and inaccessible from the test project.
    *   **Action**: Changed `CompleteAutoRegistration` to `public` in `src/AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs`.
*   **Debugging Test Failures (Circular Dependency in All Tests)**:
    *   **Problem**: Most tests failed with "Circular dependency detected" errors, even those not designed for it.
    *   **Analysis**: The `InNamespaceStartingWith("tests")` filter was too broad, including the `CircularDependencies` namespace in all tests.
    *   **Action**: Refactored `tests/UnitTest1.cs` to place non-circular dependency tests in `auto_dial.tests.DependencyOrderTests` and circular dependency tests in `auto_dial.tests.CircularDependencyTests`, and adjusted `InNamespaceStartingWith` calls to target specific namespaces.

### 2.3. Addressing Compiler Warnings & Code Quality

*   **Action**: Updated `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` package reference in `src/auto-dial.csproj` to include an inclusive lower bound (`Version="8.0.0"`).
*   **Debugging Compiler Warnings (CS8618 - Non-nullable properties)**:
    *   **Problem**: `ServiceImplementation` properties `ImplementationType` and `InterfaceType` were non-nullable but not initialized in the default constructor, leading to warnings.
    *   **Action**: Added a constructor to `ServiceImplementation` to ensure proper initialization and updated `FindImplementations` to use this constructor.

## 3. Feature Enhancements & Refinements

### 3.1. Reduced Boilerplate & Multi-Namespace Support

*   **Decision/Compromise**: Agreed to introduce a single `AddAutoDial` extension method with an optional `configure` action and allow `InNamespaceStartingWith` to accept `params string[]` for multiple namespaces. This was a compromise to reduce boilerplate without introducing complex globbing/regex.
*   **Action**:
    *   Modified `src/AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs`:
        *   Changed `namespacePrefixes` to be nullable (`string[]?`) and initialized to `null` by default (meaning no namespace filtering).
        *   Updated `GetTypesToRegister`, `FindImplementations`, and `IsInterfaceEligible` to correctly handle `null` or multiple `namespacePrefixes`.
    *   Modified `src/AutoDialExtensions.cs`:
        *   Renamed `PrimeServicesForAutoRegistration` to `AddAutoDial`.
        *   Changed its signature to `public static IServiceCollection AddAutoDial(this IServiceCollection services, Action<AutoDialRegistrationBuilder>? configure = null)`.
        *   Implemented the logic to create the builder, invoke `configure`, and call `builder.CompleteAutoRegistration()`.
    *   Updated `tests/UnitTest1.cs` to use the new `AddAutoDial` API.

### 3.2. Multiple Implementations of the Same Interface

*   **Analysis**: Confirmed that `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` inherently supports multiple registrations for the same interface, and `auto_dial`'s current logic (after removing the `alreadyRegisteredServices.Contains` check) correctly passes these through.
*   **Action**: Added a new test case (`MultipleImplementationsAreRegistered`) to `tests/UnitTest1.cs` to explicitly verify this behavior.

### 3.3. Non-Interface Based Registration (Concrete Types)

*   **Analysis**: The existing logic in `FindImplementations` already had a branch for concrete types without interfaces.
*   **Action**: Added a new test case (`ConcreteTypeIsRegistered`) to `tests/UnitTest1.cs` to explicitly verify this behavior.

### 3.4. Open Generics Registration (Attempted & Deferred)

*   **Initial Attempt**: Added `IsGenericDefinition` property to `ServiceImplementation` and modified `FindImplementations` and `RegisterServices` to identify and register open generic types.
*   **Debugging Failures**: Encountered persistent failures in `OpenGenericTypeIsRegistered` test, indicating issues with how `DependencyResolver` was identifying dependencies for open generic types. Also encountered a `CS8604` warning related to null reference arguments.
*   **Decision**: Due to complexity and time constraints, it was decided to **temporarily strip out the open generics feature** to ensure overall stability and deliver other features.
*   **Action**: Reverted changes related to open generics in `src/AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs` and `src/DependencyResolver.cs`. Removed the `OpenGenericRegistrationTests` namespace and its test case from `tests/UnitTest1.cs`.

## 4. Current Status

*   All existing and newly added tests (excluding open generics) are passing.
*   The project builds with no warnings or errors.
*   The `README.md` has been comprehensively updated to reflect all new features, API changes, and usage examples.
*   The `auto_dial` library now supports:
    *   Predictable dependency resolution.
    *   Reduced boilerplate configuration via `AddAutoDial`.
    *   Scanning multiple namespaces.
    *   Registering multiple implementations of the same interface.
    *   Registering concrete types without interfaces.
    *   Robust circular dependency detection.

## 5. Next Steps / Pending Items

*   **Revisit Open Generics Registration**: This feature was temporarily removed and needs to be re-evaluated and implemented in a future session. It requires careful consideration of how `DependencyResolver` handles generic type definitions in dependency graphs.

This concludes the verbose log for Session 1.
