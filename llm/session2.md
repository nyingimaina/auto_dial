# Session Log: auto_dial Project - Session 2

This log details the work performed and decisions made during Session 2 on the `auto_dial` project. It serves as a comprehensive record to facilitate seamless continuation in future sessions.

## 1. Initial Problem & Core Mandate

**Problem Identified:** The `auto_dial` library's initial design was "greedy," automatically registering any class matching its scan filters. This led to:
*   **Inefficiency:** Potential for a large number of unintended registrations.
*   **Incorrect Registrations:** Non-service classes (e.g., data models, utility classes) could be registered, polluting the DI container and potentially causing runtime issues.

**Core Mandate:** Transition from an "opt-out" (greedy) model to an "opt-in" model for service registration, ensuring safety and explicitness, while also addressing developer experience and flexibility.

## 2. Feature Implementations & Design Evolution

This session focused on implementing several key features, each with its own BRS, to address the core mandate and subsequent refinements.

### 2.1. FEAT-001: Transition to Attribute-Based Opt-In for Service Registration

*   **Problem:** The initial greedy registration.
*   **Solution:** Mandate the `[ServiceLifetime]` attribute as the explicit opt-in signal for registration. Classes without this attribute are ignored.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   Modified `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.FindImplementations` to only consider types with `[ServiceLifetime]`.
    *   Removed `GetServiceLifetime` and `HasServiceLifetimeAttribute` as their logic was integrated.
*   **Rationale:** Provides unambiguous intent and prevents accidental registrations. It shifts the default from "register everything" to "register nothing unless told."
*   **Impact:** This was a breaking change from the previous implicit registration, requiring existing services to be decorated.
*   **Files Modified:** `src/AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs`, `tests/UnitTest1.cs` (updated existing test services with `[ServiceLifetime]`), `tests/OptOutTests.cs` (new test).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` updated to reflect the new opt-in model.

### 2.2. FEAT-002: Enhance Dependency Resolution with Pre-emptive Error Diagnostics

*   **Problem:** Downstream errors for DI misconfigurations (e.g., missing dependencies) were hard to troubleshoot due to vague stack traces.
*   **Solution:** Implement pre-emptive validation in `DependencyResolver` to detect unregistered dependencies and provide more detailed circular dependency messages.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   `DependencyResolver` now throws `InvalidOperationException` with specific messages if a constructor parameter cannot be resolved.
    *   Circular dependency messages now include the dependency chain (e.g., `ServiceA -> ServiceB -> ServiceA`).
*   **Rationale:** Improves developer experience by failing fast with actionable error messages.
*   **Files Modified:** `src/DependencyResolver.cs`, `tests/UnitTest1.cs` (new `ErrorHandlingTests`).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` updated with new error messages and troubleshooting guidance.

### 2.3. FEAT-003: Refine Dependency Validation to Recognize Manually Registered Services

*   **Problem:** FEAT-002's validation was too aggressive, throwing false positives for services manually registered *before* `AddAutoDial()` was called.
*   **Solution:** Make `DependencyResolver` aware of the `IServiceCollection`'s existing registrations.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder` now passes the `IServiceCollection` to `DependencyResolver`.
    *   `DependencyResolver` checks both `auto_dial`'s batch and the `IServiceCollection` for dependencies.
*   **Rationale:** Allows seamless mixing of manual and automatic registration, a common real-world scenario, without false errors.
*   **Important Note:** Documentation emphasizes that manual registrations *must* occur before `AddAutoDial()` for `auto_dial` to see them.
*   **Files Modified:** `src/AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs`, `src/DependencyResolver.cs`, `tests/UnitTest1.cs` (new `HybridRegistrationTests`).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` updated to clarify hybrid registration and ordering.

### 2.4. FEAT-004: Dependency Validation Exemption for Framework Types

*   **Problem:** FEAT-003 still threw errors for common framework types (e.g., `ILogger<T>`, `IOptions<T>`) that are resolved by the DI container automatically without explicit user registration.
*   **Solution:** `DependencyResolver` now has a built-in exemption list for these framework types.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   `DependencyResolver.IsExempt` method added to check for known framework namespaces, specific types (`IServiceProvider`), and open generics (`IEnumerable<>`, `IOptions<>`, `ILogger<>`).
    *   Primitive types and `string` are also exempted.
*   **Rationale:** Prevents false positives for standard .NET patterns, making the validator practical for real applications.
*   **Files Modified:** `src/DependencyResolver.cs`, `src/auto-dial.csproj` (added `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` package references), `tests/UnitTest1.cs` (new `FrameworkExemptionTests`).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` updated to mention smart dependency validation.

### 2.5. FEAT-005: Extensible Dependency Exemption List

*   **Problem:** Developers needed a way to extend the exemption list for their own custom types or third-party libraries.
*   **Solution:** Provide methods on `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder` to allow users to define custom exemptions.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder` now stores user-defined exemption rules (`_ignoredDependencyTypes`, `_ignoredDependencyNamespaces`, `_ignoredDependencyPredicates`).
    *   New methods: `IgnoreDependency<T>()`, `IgnoreDependenciesFromNamespace()`, `IgnoreDependencyWhere()`.
    *   `DependencyResolver.IsExempt` now checks user-defined exemptions first.
*   **Rationale:** Provides flexibility and extensibility for the dependency validator.
*   **Files Modified:** `src/AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs`, `src/DependencyResolver.cs`, `tests/UnitTest1.cs` (new `ExtensibleExemptionTests`).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` updated to explain these new exemption methods.

### 2.6. FEAT-006: Convention-Based Registration

*   **Problem:** The `[ServiceLifetime]` attribute, while safe, introduced boilerplate.
*   **Solution:** Allow users to define custom conventions for registration, reducing the need for attributes on every class, while ensuring attributes still take precedence.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder` now stores a `_conventionPredicate` and `_conventionDefaultLifetime`.
    *   New method: `RegisterByConvention(Func<Type, bool> conventionPredicate, ServiceLifetime defaultLifetime)`.
    *   `AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.FindImplementations` now applies the convention if no `[ServiceLifetime]` attribute is present.
*   **Rationale:** Balances boilerplate reduction ("magic") with explicit control.
*   **Files Modified:** `src/AutoDialRegistrationBuilder.cs`, `tests/UnitTest1.cs` (new `ConventionRegistrationTests`).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` updated to introduce `RegisterByConvention` and its interplay with `[ServiceLifetime]`.

### 2.7. FEAT-007: Built-in Type Filtering Predicates

*   **Problem:** Writing custom `Func<Type, bool>` predicates for conventions and exemptions could be repetitive and complex.
*   **Solution:** Provide a static helper class `TypeFilters` with common, reusable predicates.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   New file `src/TypeFilters.cs` created.
    *   Implemented predicates: `InheritsOrImplements`, `Implements`, `HasAttribute`, `EndsWith`, `StartsWith`, `IsInNamespace`.
*   **Rationale:** Simplifies the use of predicate-based configuration, making `RegisterByConvention` and `IgnoreDependencyWhere` more accessible.
*   **Files Created:** `src/TypeFilters.cs`.
*   **Files Modified:** `tests/UnitTest1.cs` (new `TypeFilterTests`).
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` updated to showcase `TypeFilters` in the "Levels of Granularity" section.

## 3. Known Issues / Pending Items

*   **Compiler Warnings:** Two `CS8600` and `CS8602` warnings remain in `src/DependencyResolver.cs` related to nullability checks. These were deemed acceptable for now as the project builds successfully.
*   **Test Output:** The `dotnet test` command sometimes does not display detailed test results in the current environment, requiring assumptions about test success.
